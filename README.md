# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I like to be up and running on a new machine quickly, so this repo will be my effort to do just this.

# getting started

1. Make sure fish or zsh is installed and set as your login shell
2. Make sure ohmyfish (https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) or ohmyzsh (http://ohmyz.sh) is installed
3. cd ~; git clone git@github.com:HenrikWL/dotfiles.git .dotfiles;
4. cd .dotfiles; git submodule init; git submodule update;
5. script/bootstrap.sh
6. Profit
